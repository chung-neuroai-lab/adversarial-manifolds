# Adversarial Manifolds
This repository accompanies the paper "Neural Population Geometry Reveals the Role of Stochasticity in Robust Perception" providing code to demonstrate our analysis.

Notebook 1: MFTMA of Adversarial Representations on Vision Models (coming soon):
 - provides an example of using ART and related libraries to initialize and train a VOneNet on CIFAR as well as example / instructions for loading other models like used in the paper (adv trained / VOneNet pretrained on imagenet, etc).
 - example of using ART to attack the resultant network, 
 - example of feature extraction and preprocessing for analysis, etc.,
 - example of using MFTMA or SVM analysis to analyze class or exemplar manifolds representations
 - visualizing the results
