# Adversarial Manifolds
This repository accompanies the paper "Neural Population Geometry Reveals the Role of Stochasticity in Robust Perception" providinge example code to demonstrate our analysis.

MFTMA_analyze_adversarial_representations.ipynb provides examples of
 - loading CIFAR10 VOneResNet18 and regular ResNet18 (adversarially trained ResNet18 coming)
 - constructing class or exemplar manifolds
 - using ART to attack the resultant networks
 - feature extraction and preprocessing for analysis
 - using MFTMA or SVM analysis to analyze class or exemplar manifolds representations
 - plotting the results

Stay tuned for more notebooks, showing how to generate VOneResNet18 with Gaussian noise for CIFAR10, and other demos.
