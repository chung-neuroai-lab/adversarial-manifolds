Notebook 1 (coming soon):
 - provides an example of using ART and related libraries to initialize and train a VOneNet on CIFAR (or maybe MNIST, for computational convenience) as well as example / instructions for loading other models like used in the paper (adv trained / VOneNet pretrained on imagenet, etc).
 - example of using ART to attack the resultant network, for a set of images extract features, etc.,
 - example of using MFTMA or SVM analysis to analyze class or exemplar manifolds representations
 - plot the results
